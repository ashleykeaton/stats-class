# Introduction {-}

This book will focus on a conceptual introduction to multilevel Bayesian models. I am going to talk about math as little as possible, so I am going to avoid giving details unless necessary. My goal is to convey some of the more important and useful concepts necessary to begin to understand these models and to use them in your own work. I hope to set you up in a position to 'fill in the blanks' as necessary later. 

I am going to try to provide intuitive explanations for statistical models that rely on understanding the figures we use represent and interpret them. The book assumes a reasonable understanding of R, but none of statistics. I don't really 'explain' many basic things, for example, how to calculate a standard deviation? Why is it calculated like it is? The reason for this is that first, there are many better resources for that. And second, I am trying to make this quick, to go from 0 to understanding and interpreting Bayesian multilevel models in 10 weeks.
