# Main Title
  
This is where I write some text

## Sub-heading

Some more text. 

```{r}
##here I plot some numbers
plot (rnorm (10))
```

Below I make the plot without showing the code after:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
##here I plot some numbers
plot (rnorm (10))
```

Below I run the code but do not include any output in the output file. 
```{r, include = FALSE}
##here I plot some numbers
plot (rnorm (10))
greeting = "hello"
```

However the action still runs, as demonstrated below:
```{r}
greeting
```
